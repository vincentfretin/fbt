`fbt:plural` provides you with a shorthand way for plural variations.
```
<fbt desc="plural example">
  You have
  <fbt:plural
    count={getLikeCount()}
    name="number of likes"
    showCount="ifMany"
    many="likes">
     a like
  </fbt:plural>
  on your
  <fbt:plural
    count={getPhotoCount()}
    showCount="no">
     photo
  </fbt:plural>.
</fbt>
```
OR
```js
fbt(
  'You have ' +
    fbt.plural('a like', getLikeCount(), {
      name: 'number of likes,
      showCount: 'ifMany',
      many: 'likes',
    }) +
    ' on your ' +
    fbt.plural('photo', getPhotoCount()),
  'plural example',
);
```

Both the above examples generate the following during [collection](collection).

#### Required arguments:
* **singular phrase** `string`: JSX child in `<fbt:plural>` and argument 1 in `fbt.plural`
* **count** `number`: `count` in `<fbt:plural>` and argument 2 in `fbt.plural`

#### Optional arguments:
* **many** `string`: Represents the plural form of the string in English.  Default is `{singular} + 's'`
* **showCount** `"yes"|"no"|"ifMany"`: Whether to show the `{number}` in the string.   
*Note that the singular phrase never has a token, but inlines to `1`. This is to account for languages like Hebrew for which showing the actual number isn't appropriate*

  * **"no"**: (*DEFAULT*) Don't show the count
  * **"ifMany"**: Show the count only in plural case
  * **"yes"**: Show the count in all cases
* **name** `string`: Name of the token where count shows up. (*Default*: `"number"`) 
* **value** `mixed`: For overriding the displayed `number`
